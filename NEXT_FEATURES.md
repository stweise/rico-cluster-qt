# Collection of next features to implement

* pan on whiteboard using space bar + mouse drag
* add direction arrow to edges
* allow multiline node labels (it is often more pragmatic and space saving to have this)
  * provide several centering options
  * store line breaks so they are used correctly on every platform
  * trigger line breaks with "shift+enter" and "ctrl+enter" in multiline edit, finish dialog with "enter"
* replace ellipses as a node signifier with something more practical (text comes as a rectangle ...), probably a rounded rectangle
* create preferences menu
  * allow stylizing node labels (bold, italics, color)
  * allow stylizing node color (fill, border)
	* create presets, which can be overwritten
